### I learned how to:

- Work with Computed Properties
- Create a toolbar above the keyboard
- Set min and max values for Slider
- Convert Strings to Int / Double and vice versa
- Handle calculations with formulas written in the Model
- Enable or disable objects based on if the keyboard is open
- Get values from the UISlider and convert them to Int for use in the Model

Tools: react-native, react-native-elements
